## Structural Integrity & Responsivity Testing
For these tests, I observed the behaviour of each page of the website within eleven device profiles via Google Chrome's developer tools. The devices tested were as follows:
<ul>
    <li>iPhone SE (SE)</li>
    <li>iPhone XR (XR)</li>
    <li>iPhone 12 Pro (12P)</li>
    <li>iPad Air (A)</li>
    <li>iPad Mini (M)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy S8+ (S8+)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (S20U)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy A51/71 (A51)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy Fold (F)</li>
    <li>Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (SP7)</li>
    <li>Microsoft Surface Duo (SD)</li>
</ul>

### Confirmation Message (confirmation page)

This particular page was not responsive, as at the time of doing these tests, I had completely forgotten to make it so. However, I have since added responsivity to it. Unlike the other pages, it required min-height media queries in order to display properly on tablet devices, as it is naturally the shortest page on the website. Without these media queries, the page did not stretch the full height of any of the tablet displays, leaving white space below itself.

## Link Testing

For these tests, I simply clicked on every link on the site to make sure that they led to where they were supposed to. In the case of the navigation bar, I checked to make sure that the correct link was highlighted for a given page.

### Home Page

<table>
    <tr> <th>Home</th> <th>Menu</th> <th>Find Us</th> <th>Contact Us</th> <th>Menu Link</th> <th>Facebook</th> <th>Twitter</th> <th>Instagram</th> <th>Youtube</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> </tr>
</table>

### Menu Page

<table>
    <tr> <th>Home</th> <th>Menu</th> <th>Find Us</th> <th>Contact Us</th> <th>Facebook</th> <th>Twitter</th> <th>Instagram</th> <th>Youtube</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> </tr>
</table>

### Contact Us Page

<table>
    <tr> <th>Home</th> <th>Menu</th> <th>Find Us</th> <th>Contact Us</th> <th>Submit</th> <th>Facebook</th> <th>Twitter</th> <th>Instagram</th> <th>Youtube</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning + highlight</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> <td>functioning</td> </tr>
</table>

## Form Testing

For this final set of tests, I entered various combinations of text into the fields and attempted to submit it. The hope was that submission would only be possible if all four fields were completed, and that the email address field contained a valid email address.

<ul>
    <li>First name only: NO</li>
    <li>Last name only: NO</li>
    <li>Valid email address only: NO</li>
    <li>Message only: NO</li>
    <li>First name and last name only: NO</li>
    <li>First name and valid email address only: NO</li>
    <li>First name and message only: NO</li>
    <li>Last name and valid email address only: NO</li>
    <li>Last name and message only: NO</li>
    <li>Valid email address and message only: NO</li>
    <li>First name, last name, and valid email address only: NO</li>
    <li>First name, last name, and message only: NO</li>
    <li>First name, valid email address, and message only: NO</li>
    <li>Last name, valid email address, and message only: NO</li>
    <li>First name, last name, invalid email address, and message: NO</li>
    <li>First name, last name, valid email address, and message: YES</li>
</ul>

The only issue I noticed was that the email input element seems to accept my email address in this form: chrislplumb91@h, i.e. without any top-level domain. However, according to a post I read on Stack Overflow, email addresses without periods or top-level domains are technically valid, and the email input element accepts all valid email addresses. So this would seem to be a feature rather than a bug.
